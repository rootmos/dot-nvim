# .nvim

My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration.

With a way to build and install in isolation in order to comfortably:
- change configuration
- try an updated Neovim version
- try out and play with new plugins (or their updated versions)

I can image that many (most?) text editor aficionados have encountered
the [petard hoisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoist_with_his_own_petard) nature
of editing a broken configuration with the same broken editor!
